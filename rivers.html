     <h1>The thrill of adventure</h1> We have to start with the most obvious health benefit, which is providing you with an adrenaline rush. Going through each turn of the river and battling through every rapid boosts your adrenaline, and this is needed to enjoy a more healthy, long life. Which is why, the thrill of the adventure, or adrenaline rush, is the first health benefit on our list.

<h2>The Outdoors & Fresh Air = Reduced Stress.</h2>
When people are getting tired of their jobs or just tired in general, one way they can reduce their stress is by going outdoors. Now, studies show that being outdoors in fresh air, and not cooped up in your office, is far more beneficial to your mental health and stress levels than any indoor activities. Even the silence that nature brings is relaxing and helps you to alleviate your stress.

<h3>Great for Cardio & Strengthening Muscles.</h3>
Now, most people know how physically challenging white water river rafting can be, but, itâ€™s so much more than that. In fact, for river rafting, you are mostly using your upper body to paddle through the water, which tones your arms, back, shoulders and even strengthens your ability to think. Likewise, with regards to cardio, as a strenuous activity which requires endurance, rafters need to sustain long periods of paddling. Meaning, rafters much be at their best to ensure they can successfully accomplish the challenge.
